Maze Solver Python Project Guide

This function solves the Maze problem using Backtracking. It mainly uses solveMazeUtil() to solve the problem. It returns false if no path is possible, otherwise return true and prints the path in the form of 1s.

Approach................

In a maze.... we have to find path from source to destination...

in left top corner [0][0] is the source maze and in right bottom corner is destination

There are few cells which are blocked sowe can not go to that cells. we can move in any direction.

Create a solution matrix of the same structure

whenever we move in a cell ... mark that cell in solution matrix.

At the end print solution

Function A ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Algorithm..............

Create a solution matrix, initially filled with 0’s.

Create a recursive funtion, which takes initial matrix, output matrix and position of source (i, j).

if the position is out of the matrix or the position is not valid then return.

Mark the position output[i][j] as 1 and check if the current position is destination or not. If destination is reached print the output matrix and return.

Recursively call for position (i+1, j) and (i, j+1).

Unmark position (i, j), i.e output[i][j] = 0.

Function B ^^^^^^^^^^

Input..................

Open the code in vs editor

Open cmd terminal in vs code

Type command (maze.py) and press enter

Now type size of matrix(example- 4) and press enter

Now enter matrix as size you entered before with space and enter (example 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 )

Solution will be printed sucessfully

** Note ** @ Please enter only binary digits (0,1) where 0 means blocked cell and 1 means active cell. @ If you put size 3 it means 3 rows and 3 column, same goes in 4, 5 etc

Function C ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Output.................

It will print (No Path Found) if no path is available

Or you will get solved matrix if path is possible.
